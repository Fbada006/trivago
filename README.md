üëÄ  Writing Trivago Interview Solution App using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin, using Android Jetpack Components. 

### Prerequisites 

Before every commit, make sure you run the following commands:

```shell script
./gradlew ktlintFormat

./gradlew ktlintCheck

./gradlew detekt

./gradlew spotlessApply
```

Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10248), if you get any issues running the lint commands on the terminal :rocket:

### Background

Implement a small but scalable app which interacts with the open [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). The app should contain 2 main areas:

- Character Search (Home Screen)
- Character Details

The following attributes should be displayed for the character details:

- name
- birth year
- height (in cm and feet/inches)
- name (species)
- language (species)
- homeworld (species)
- population (planets)
- films (movies the character appeared in)
- opening crawl (detailed description of each movie)

On app start, the user lands on the character search screen. The user can search for characters from the Star Wars universe. The result of the search should display a character list. When tapping on a character, details are displayed as defined above.
